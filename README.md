# VW Bluetooth research

Here I will post some links that I've found useful while researching stuff about
Bluetooth modules in VAG cars. My ultimate goal of this research is to replace
original module with Raspberry Pi (or another suitable SBC) for phone/music
streaming functionality, as well as Android Auto screen connected to OEM radio
unit, all with as little modifications to OEM as possible.

It's becoming really hard to find any info in one place, that's why I made this
repo.
